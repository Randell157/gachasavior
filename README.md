# Gacha Savior App

This is my final CAPSTONE project for Computer Science!

This is a website that allows people to track and organize their information for various gacha games, starting with Genshin Impact! Will update to have more in the future!

Using Vercel to host the website for now: https://gachasavior.vercel.app/
